We will be hosting stress-free and casual game nights at Mangia Pizza every month to get to see new faces and friends every 2nd Saturday of the month. We reserve a big room to accommodate everyone for a safe and inviting environment for introverts and extroverts alike. Once in a while we may have other spontaneous events. Please come and have fun. Don't be shy! You'll be surprised who you meet with. In this meetup you will have new experiences and perspectives with the diversity Austin offers. You can meet professors, blacksmiths, singers, food critics, etc. And it is always interesting to see how others think while we talk and game. (Yes, we're looking at you Dixit and Scrabble players)"

We like to do things but without being around people who are loud, and other traits usually associated with extroverts. Activities include eating out, movies, discussions about everything under the sun, arts events, and more. We are open to all activities, as long as introverts who identify with more than one culture can hang out."
